In this repository, I included the main analysis models used in my dissertation (Chapter 3 and 4).

**Required R Libraries**

Several R libraries were used when conducting statistical analyses:

- dplyr and tidyr were used to handle dataframes.
- lmerTest and lme4 were used to conduct linear mixed effect regression analysis.
- car was used to conduct ANCOVA analysis.
- stats was used to conduct multiple linear regression analysis. 
- ggplot2 was used for generating figures, including scatterplots and boxplots.
